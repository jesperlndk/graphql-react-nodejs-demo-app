# React + GraphQL + Node.js REST API - Example app

**An example of how to build a React web application, a GraphQL server and a Node.js REST API.**  
The project is called "Movie Explorer" and the application enables the user to explore movies of San Francisco in a user-friendly and graphical way.  
The project consists of 3 elements: [api](https://github.com/jesperlndk/graphql-react-nodejs-demo-app/tree/master/api), [graphql-server](https://github.com/jesperlndk/graphql-react-nodejs-demo-app/tree/master/graphql-server) and [client](https://github.com/jesperlndk/graphql-react-nodejs-demo-app/tree/master/client).

## About
I created this project in September 2018 as a part of an interview process.  
It was a "coding challenge" saying something like: "Take [this dataset](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am) of filming locations in San Francisco from DataSF, and create an interesting, interactive experience around it".

My vision was to create responsive, modern IMDb-like web application, enabling the user to discover the movies from San Francisco.  
The user should be able to browse, search and explore movies, based on eg. actors and writers, genres or locations.Â 
Additional features like charts and histograms should allow the user to get a deeper understanding of the underlying dataset.
